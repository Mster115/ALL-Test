        <h3>Accessibility Standards</h3>

        <p>
          In order to establish accessibility standards throughout
          government-run technology applications, allowing for anyone with or
          without a disability to interact with fundamental government websites,
          kiosks, and mobile applications,{" "}

          was established in 1998. This section outlines all of the necessary
          components of web infrastructure to keep its promise to ensure
          applications are accessible to all.{" "}

          is fundamental to this project, as it outlines the necessity for

          . This relates directly to this web application, as its main focus is
          to outline and teach the necessity of creating accessible software to
          ensure individuals with hearing loss can properly identify prominent
          information in studentâ€™s web applications moving forward.

        <h3>NAD vs Netflix Lawsuit</h3>

        <p>
          In 2011, the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) filed a{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.3playmedia.com/2015/07/23/nad-v-netflix-ada-lawsuit-requires-closed-captioning-on-streaming-video/"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            alt="Lawsuit"
          >
            lawsuit
          </a>{" "}
          against Netflix due to the lack of closed captioning in their
          streaming videos, which is considered as a violation of the ADA. More
          than half of all Americans use Netflix. Thus it must be made
          accessible to Deaf and Hard of Hearing viewers. Netflix argues that
          the ADA only specified that "places of public accommodation" must be
          accessible to people with disabilities and its business cannot be
          considered a "place of public accommodation" since it is not a
          physical place. Hence, Netflix is not subject to the ADA. NAD argued
          that the Internet is not exempt from the ADA, and Netflix is
          considered a shared or public activity, which makes the ADA
          applicable. The judge ruled in favor of the NAD's argument. Thus,
          Netflix had to add subtitles for their streaming videos (shown in
          Figure 1) to make their website accessible for Deaf and Hard of
          Hearing users.

          considered in everything we create for the web, as without it, we are
          not treating individuals with a hearing loss as a stakeholder in
          computing, we are discriminating against their use of our
